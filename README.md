# Dataccess

Web application that allows you to administer an Oracle database. The application allows you to list the schemas (exclusively created users starting with c##) and to access the tables they contain. It is possible to perform several operations on tables and databases (creation, deletion, consultation). It is also possible to execute queries directly in sql oracle. 

## Configuration

To use the application you have to modify the application.properties file under src/main/resources and fill in a username and a password to connect to the database (it may be necessary to change the filled in url).
